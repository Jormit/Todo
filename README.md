- Quake style game engine.
    * Can load 3d models (.obj, .md2, .md3..) and do basic transformations and keyframe animation.
    * Can load maps and check collision with walls and ground.
    * Lighting.
    * Projectiles with collision.
    * Display numbers on screen (eg. health, fps ...).

- Mathematical equation graphing tool (2d and 3d).
    * Allow for arbitary expressions to be entered with x, y, z coordinates.
    * Parse expression and display a 3d or 2d graph of this relationship. (Probably won't parse dynamically, but will need to be compiled instead.). 
- Vst compressor.
    * Threshold, ratio and gain settings.
    * Smooth envelope follower.
- Vst reverb.
